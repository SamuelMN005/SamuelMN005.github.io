Education
======
- **Ph.D** studying "Towards Mobile Inclusive Human-Robot Collaboration via Supervisory Control and Multimodal Interactions with Telepresence Robots", *Cardiff University*, 2028 (***expected***)
- **BEng** in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with year in industry, *Cardiff University*, 2023 (***First Class Honours***)

Work experience
======
- (Oct. 2023 - Ongoing) **Teaching Associate**
  - Cardiff University
  - Duties includes: Help to deliver and mark course material within Cardiff University School of Computer Science and Informatics.

- (Nov. 2021 - Nov. 2022) **Student Research Assistant (<a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence-robotics-and-human-machine-systems">IRHOMS</a>)**
  - Cardiff University
  - Duties included: Helped in the development, design, and presentation of research projects regarding Human Robot Interaction for Cardiff School of Computer Science & Informatics. In addition, helped in the creation of demonstrations with Pepper robot for Cardiff University’s open days. Within the placement I expanded my knowledge in Python and ROS. Learned to code in C#, Choregraphe and develop simulations with Gazebo Classic and Unity.
  
Skills
======
- **COMMUNICATION**: Being a Student Academic Representative for the engineering department helped me dialogue and express ideas or concerns from the students to the committee in a more direct and concise manner.
- **CREATIVE**: As part of a module, a track and trace device using Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Within my group I was assigned the development of conversion from signal strength to distance. To solve this problem, I wrote a code in MATLAB to automate the process of analysing the environment
using diverse statistical techniques to output the function which resembled the propagation of the signal. Thus, speeding development and reducing the system’s overall systematic error.
- **TEAMWORK**: As part of Cardiff University Computational Robotics, a growing team of 9 people, we support each other by spreading our knowledge towards ongoing research either by sharing articles or advising in the implementation code into systems from the shared GitHub repositories.
- **TIME MANAGEMENT**: As part of the Engineering Project Management module, I learned to create and update accordingly to the workflow a Gantt chart accommodating new challenges throughout the development of the final year project. In addition, I learned the Project Fundamentals Qualification as part of the module.

Achievements
======
- **Advanced Altium Designer 19 Certificate**: learned optimized methods for speeding the PCB design whilst maintaining signal integrity and correct power distribution throughout the board. In addition, learned to design in rigid and flexible PCBs. Also, to create appropriate documentation and schematic layout to follow industry standards.
- **Gold Crest Award**: An investigation of the charge and discharge of capacitors for a specific camera flash (grade: Pass)
- **Two Headmaster’s Copy Price**: Awarded twice for being the first student in Sutton Valence School to achieve the Gold Crest Award and for the Extended Project Qualification for producing a robotic hand which mimicked the user’s hand.

Interests
======
- **Student Academic Representative**, *Committee Member* (2019 - 2021)
  - School of Engineering, Cardiff University
  - Helped me develop my communication skills by acting as a gateway for students undergoing Electrical and Electronics Engineering to provide feedback to academics.
* **Student Formula Racing Team**, *Group Member* (2019 - 2020)
  - School of Engineering, Cardiff University
  - Helped in a dynamic test to ensure the safety of the car with the help of another team member. In addition, I have helped to attach all electronic components of the steering wheel.
- **Autonomous Formula Racing Team**, *Group Member* (2019 - 2022)
  - School of Engineering, Cardiff University
  - I learned to use ROS framework which produces a communication between python, C++ programs and hardware to produce communication for the visual system. In addition, I have modified a router as an access point creating a private network between two laptops.
- **Cardiff University Computational Robotics Team (CUCR)**, *Group Member* (2022 - Ongoing)
  - School of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University
  - Actively engaged in the discussion of a diverse numbers of articles regarding path planning algorithms and Human-Robot Interaction. Additionally, I have contributed to the shared repositories for easier implementation of ROS packages within the CUCR environment.

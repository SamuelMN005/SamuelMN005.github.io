I am a passionate student looking into the intersection between VR telepresence robotics and social navigation. This website provides an insite into some of the work I have been doing throughout my PhD. Always welcome to collaborate in developing articles, conferences, events, journals and workshops so please feel free to reach out through social media or send an email!

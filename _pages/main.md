I am a passionate student looking into the intersection between Human Robot Interaction, VR telepresence robotics and social navigation. This website provides an insite into some of the work I have been doing throughout my PhD. `Always open to collaborate in developing articles, conferences, events, journals and workshops, so please feel free to reach out through social media or send an email!`

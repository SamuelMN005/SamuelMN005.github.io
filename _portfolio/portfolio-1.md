The aim of this work was to support the community by providing an open-source simulation of the Stretch robot, designed by Hello Robot Inc. 

The simulation provides a platform utilising the stretch robot to develop autonomous systems for navigation and mobile manipulation tasks. It uses ROS2 and Gazebo Sim Harmonic. The mobile base was designed utilising a differential controller. The robot joints, including the head, lift, arm and gripper, can be manipulated individually using an individual PID controller for each joint. A lidar and RGBD camera were implemented following the creatorsâ€™ design for the sensors.

This work aimed to enable the URDF-Importer package to be used with a Virtual Reality (VR) Head Mounted Display (HMD). This required the use of Unity for Android platforms. Unfortunately, the default URDF-Importer package was not made for Android platforms. Thus, after analyzing and digging into the code, I decided to open-source a new version of the URDF-Importer package, which allows it to be used with Android platforms. It did not work due to the plugins used within the package, which were not compiled for Android use. Thus, I found an alternative solution and provided a description within the `README.md` file to make everything functional.

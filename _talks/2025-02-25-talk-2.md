The School of Computer Science & Informatics hads the pleasure to showcase Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications to ERASMUS students attending Cardiff University. This event was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/erasmusatcardiff/">ERASMUS@Cardiff</a>. 

Students used three different demonstrations with the VR headsets. The first two demos used the Oculus Quest 3, applying AR technology. The third demo used the Oculus Quest 2, showing VR technology. The first demo showcased a custom robotic pick and place operation using a simulated robotic arm based on <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/pick_and_place/README.md">unity's robotic hub tutorials</a>. Students had great fun manipulating the object required for the pick and place operation. Some of them emphasised the utility of such technology in real world applications. For the second demo, students played a videogame developed by <a href="https://about.meta.com/uk/">Meta</a> in which they competed to see who had the highest score. The third demo showcased a telepresence approach to teleoperate a stretch robot (developed by <a href="https://hello-robot.com">Hello Robot Inc.</a> and simulated in <a href="https://www.samuelmillannorman.com/talks/2025-01-29-talk-1">Gazebo Sim Harmonic</a>) within a social environment.
